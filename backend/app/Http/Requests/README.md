# Request Forms

Request forms have the responsibility to validate the user request and
prepare the data for being used. and the request forms are
bounded to the api, therefore it's a good practice to categorize them
based on the api they are bounded. in here they are for first version
of the api therefore they are under `Api\V1` namespace.
