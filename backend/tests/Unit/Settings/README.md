# Setting Manager

The setting manager responsibility is to manage
all setting actions throughout the application.

**Caution:** the manager is being set to treats all
setting values as string, so if you need to
expand this behaviour for instance supporting
array values, you need to implement it yourself,
but the code is implemented pretty flexible to new
requirements.
